       jiujitsu is derived using the Hepburn romanization system. Before the first of the 20th century
       however, jiu-jitsu were preffered, even though the romanization of the 
       second kanji as jitsu is unfaithfull to the standard japaneese prounancion.
       since japaneese martial arts first became widely known of in the West in that time 
       period , These earlier spellings are still common in many places
